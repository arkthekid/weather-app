### Why I Developed This Project

I created this Weather App because I wanted to build something that could help people in their daily lives. Almost all of us check the weather every day so I thought it would be cool to make an app that does this in a simple, user-friendly way. Plus, after working on this project I understood more about web development and learned more about how to connect front-end design with external APIs. It was a fun experience that taught me a lot about implementing practical, real-world applications.

### How the App Works

The Weather App allows users to enter their location and retrieve real-time weather information. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it works:
1. **User Input**: The user enters their location in the search box.
2. **Fetch Weather Data**: The app sends a request to a weather API to fetch the current weather data for the entered location.
3. **Display Data**: The app displays the weather information, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. If the location is invalid, an error message is shown.
4. **User Experience**: The app includes animations and responsive design to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Technologies Involved

The development of this Weather App involved the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com): For handling user interactions and API requests.
- [**OpenWeather API**](https://openweathermap.org): For retrieving real-time weather data.
- [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/icons): For providing icons used in the app.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com): For custom fonts to enhance the visual design.
