### Why I Developed This Project

I developed this project to provide a user-friendly application that allows users to check the current weather conditions in their location. This project serves as a practical implementation of various web development skills and aims to offer an intuitive and efficient weather-checking experience. Additionally, it was created to enhance my understanding of integrating APIs with front-end development.

### How the App Works

The Weather App allows users to enter their location and retrieve real-time weather information. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it works:
1. **User Input**: The user enters their location in the search box.
2. **Fetch Weather Data**: The app sends a request to a weather API to fetch the current weather data for the entered location.
3. **Display Data**: The app displays the weather information, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. If the location is invalid, an error message is shown.
4. **User Experience**: The app includes animations and responsive design to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.
